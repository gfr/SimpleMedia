NOTES ON USING DOCTRINE
-----------------------
Zikula supports Doctrine 2.1. Please make sure you are reading the correct version
of the documentation looking on the vendor website
http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/2.1/docs/en

Please note that you should not use print_r() for debugging Doctrine 2 entities.
The reason for that is that these objects contain too many references which will
result in a very huge output.
Instead use the Doctrine\Common\Util\Debug::dump($data) method which reduces
the output to reasonable information.
